# Airport-Reservation-System

• Co-Developed a flight reservation full-stack application that allows users to search for flights, purchase ticket for flights, view purchase history, track spending per month and rate/comment previous flights taken.
• Designed the relational database schema used for the flight reservation system using SQL and hosted it locally through a server called MAMP. Used Python Flask to connect the HTML pages with the backend database and programmed the necessary queries for each user functionality.
• Implemented SQL queries for the database to allow users to register as an airline staff member, allowing a staff member to add flights, airports, airplanes, view customer spending, view revenue based on dates, view frequent customers, and popular destinations.
